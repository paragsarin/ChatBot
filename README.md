# ChatBot

Welcome to ChatBot, a simple yet powerful chatbot built using .NET, OpenAI, and Semantic Kernel.

## Introduction

ChatBot is a project aimed at exploring AI development through the creation of a chatbot application. Leveraging the capabilities of .NET for backend development, OpenAI for natural language processing, and Semantic Kernel for simplified communication with language models, ChatBot offers a hands-on learning experience in the exciting field of artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Integration with GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation.
- Simplified communication with different language models through Semantic Kernel.
- Support for responsible AI via built-in filters.
- Instrumentation and metrics tracking for performance monitoring.
